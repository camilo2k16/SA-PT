# SA-PT
design of a tool for learning and teaching signals using a GUIDE in MATLAB

# ABSTRAC
The tool whose initials assigned to identify it are SA&PT, it fulfills the function of providing help to students and teachers when explaining the behavior of a signal, gives us the facility that has Matlab to be able to make graphs and see the behavior of a wave according to its function original, both in continuous time and discrete time, however to be able to carry out these graphs or make the corresponding code can become complicated and complex for the user. student who is just beginning to study this subject related to signal theory, mainly because the ideas that are established on the subject are not clear, and complicate the learning, many times as a student you look for other means to be able to simulate or draw such functions or to analyze the different types of waves and signals, and is not found something useful that explains specifically to the student's need, such as graphing a function that you have at that moment and due to some conceptual problem, when trying to create the necessary script or code or in trying to understand how MATLAB works, the student cannot graph this function correctly, and therefore cannot understand how to do it. Therefore, the MATLAB GUIDE was used, a tool that gives us the opportunity to create an interface that interacts with the user so that he can choose what type of signal he wishes to analyze, This is possible because it also gives us the ease of being able to carry out different types of operations, including the display of vectors and signals. Something that greatly helps us understand the behavior of these phenomena that occur in a signal.
